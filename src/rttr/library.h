/*!
 * The \ref library class provides a cross platform way of explicit loading shared objects
 *  (`.so` on Unix based system and `.DLL` on windows).
 *
 * With a call to \ref load() the library will be loaded and with \ref unload() unloaded.
 * The explicit call to \ref unload() is not necessary. An internal ref count will trigger the unload automatically
 * on application exit.
 *
 * After loading the registered type in the library are known to the type system of RTTR.
 * The \ref type "types" or global \ref property "properties" or  \ref method "methods"
 * can be retrieved directly from the library class via getters.
 *
 * Because the types are registered via RTTR inside the \ref RTTR_REGISTRATION macro
 * It is not necessary to additionally mark your types for export (e.g. using `__declspec( dllexport )` on windows)
 *
 * Copying and Assignment
 * ----------------------
 * A \ref library object cannot be copied or assigned.
 *
 * Typical Usage
 * ----------------------
 * A typical usage example is the following:
 *  \code{.cpp}
 *   library lib("MyPlugin"); // file suffix is not needed, will be automatically appended
 *   lib.load();
 *   auto type_list = t.get_types();
 *   for (auto& t : type_list)
 *   {
 *      std::cout << "loaded types: " << t.get_name() << std::endl;
 *   }
 *
 *  \endcode

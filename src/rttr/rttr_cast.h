 * \brief Casts the given \p object of type \p Source_Type to an object of type \p Target_Type.
 *
 * When the given the given \p object is an instance of type \p Target_Type, then this function will cast the pointer to the \p TargetType;
 * otherwise it will return a `nullptr`. If \p object is already a `nullptr` then it will also return a `nullptr`.
 *
 * \remark Both class types must contain the macro \ref RTTR_ENABLE in the class declaration.
 *        \p Source_Type and \p Target_Type must be both pointer types.
 *
 *
 * \return A pointer of type \p Target_Type
